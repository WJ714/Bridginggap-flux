👋 Welcome to the Bridging the Gap: Flux Data Meets Land Surface Models - FLUX tutorials!
### 🔗 What is Binder?
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is an open-source service that makes GitHub repositories interactive.
With just one click, users can launch a virtual compute environment with all dependencies installed. It is especially useful for teaching, code demonstrations, and sharing reproducible research.
# 📚 Two tutorials are included here:
1. 🚀 Get started with FLUXNET data  
2. ⚙️ REddyProc: Typically it takes > 30 mins to install the package, you are encouraged to use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YujieLiu666/FCC_workshop_flux_test/main?urlpath=rstudio)


## 🚀 FLUXNET 

- 📊 The [FLUXNET2015](https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/) dataset includes data collected at sites from multiple regional flux networks.  
- 🚀 The [next generation](https://fluxnet.org/2024/09/17/announcing-the-fluxnet-data-system-initiative/) of global, open, and accessible FLUXNET data will be available soon.

## ⚙️ REddyProc

Standard and extensible Eddy-Covariance data post-processing (Wutzler et al., 2018) includes uStar-filtering, gap-filling, and flux-partitioning.  
🌿 The Eddy-Covariance (EC) micrometeorological technique quantifies continuous exchange fluxes of gases, energy, and momentum between an ecosystem and the atmosphere.  
⚙️ It is important for understanding ecosystem dynamics and upscaling exchange fluxes (Aubinet et al., 2012).  

This package inputs pre-processed (half-)hourly data and supports further processing:

- 1️⃣ First, a quality-check and filtering is performed based on the relationship between measured flux and friction velocity (uStar) to discard biased data (Papale et al., 2006).  
- 2️⃣ Second, gaps in the data are filled based on information from environmental conditions (Reichstein et al., 2005).  
- 3️⃣ Third, the net flux of carbon dioxide is partitioned into its gross fluxes in and out of the ecosystem by night-time based and day-time based approaches (Lasslop et al., 2010).
### Where to download the package?
