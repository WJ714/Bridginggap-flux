# What is REddyProc?
(Yujie: I just copied the text, I guess we need to improve the readability)

Standard and extensible Eddy-Covariance data post-processing (Wutzler et al. (2018) <doi:10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018>) includes uStar-filtering, gap-filling, and flux-partitioning. The Eddy-Covariance (EC) micrometeorological technique quantifies continuous exchange fluxes of gases, energy, and momentum between an ecosystem and the atmosphere. It is important for understanding ecosystem dynamics and upscaling exchange fluxes. (Aubinet et al. (2012) <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2351-1>). This package inputs pre-processed (half-)hourly data and supports further processing. First, a quality-check and filtering is performed based on the relationship between measured flux and friction velocity (uStar) to discard biased data (Papale et al. (2006) <doi:10.5194/bg-3-571-2006>). Second, gaps in the data are filled based on information from environmental conditions (Reichstein et al. (2005) <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001002.x>). Third, the net flux of carbon dioxide is partitioned into its gross fluxes in and out of the ecosystem by night-time based and day-time based approaches (Lasslop et al. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02041.x>).
