# 04: IQR filtering
-   IQR: interquartile range, which is the difference between the 75th
    percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) of a dataset;
-   Marginal distribution sampling (MDS, Reichstein et al., 2005) has
    been adopted as a standard gap-filling method;
-   Standard implementation of MDS relies on photosynthetic photon flux
    density (PPFD) (or, alternatively, global shortwave radiation) as
    the main driver, and air temperature (Tair) and vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD) as additional factors in the look-up table.
-   We first calculate the IQR of the residuals between MDS gap-filled
    values (without u\* filtering) and measured values.
-   Here, MDS gave us an initial “best guess” of what the true flux was
    for each specific half hour. The choice of 6 times the IQR is a
    conservative approach, meaning that only the most extreme values are
    filtered out (some studies have used a more aggressive threshold of
    3 times the IQR). We repeated the filtering process with 6 times of
    IQR twice to ensure sufficient outliers were removed.
-   More information can be found in Liu et al. (2025):

# 05: u\* filtering
-   u\*: Friction velocity (m/s) is a measure of turbulent mixing in the
    lower atmosphere near the surface
-   It can be thought of as a velocity scale, a representative value for a 'turbulent velocity'
-   u\* is defined using the vertical flux of horizontal momentum
-   (u\*)\^2 = overbar(u'w')\^2 + overbar(v'w')\^2
-   CO2 transport is heavily influenced by turbulent mixing.
-   Unfavorable conditions could be detected by inspecting the relationship of nighttime NEE vs. u\*.

Why is u\* filtering needed? 

- To filter out period with low turbulence
- For e.g., at night when winds are calm, the atmosphere often becomes stable with low turbulence and low mixing locally.
  - This could lead to CO2 pooling near the surface or within canopies.
- EC towers may underestimate respiration fluxes as CO2 is not being transported upward efficiently to be measured. 

Different treatments of u\* thresholds; - At low u\* values, a
negatively biased respiration is measured; - u\* threshold is the
minimum u\* above which respiration reachers a plateau; (check out the
figure under /plots) - user-specific u\* threshold - Single u\*
threshold - annual varying u *- seasonal varing u* - read more:
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REddyProc/vignettes/uStarCases.html>

```{r}
# EProc$sPlotNEEVersusUStarForSeason(format = "pdf") # keep this line commented, please check the figure under /plots
set.seed(2000)

# we are just using nSample = 10L for here for demonstration
uStarTh <- EProc$sEstUstarThresholdDistribution(nSample = 10L, probs = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95)) 
print(uStarTh)

# Define aggregation mode
EProc$sGetUstarScenarios() # by default, annual varing u* is used

# Here, we use the single u* threshold
uStar <- uStarTh  %>%
  dplyr::filter( aggregationMode == "single") %>%
  dplyr::select( "uStar", "5%", "50%", "95%")
uStarDf <- cbind(season=na.omit(unique(uStarTh$season)), uStar)
EProc$sSetUstarScenarios(uStarDf)
EProc$sGetUstarScenarios()

# if you want to use seasonal or annual varing u*:
# EProc$useSeaonsalUStarThresholds()# seasonal varing u*
# EProc$useAnnualUStarThresholds() # annual varing u*
```

Question: What aggregationMode should I use for my site?

# 06: MDS: gapfil NEE

-   The MDS combines two gap-filling techniques: the “look-up” table
    (LUT) and the “mean diurnal course” (MDC). \## “look-up” table (LUT)
    Fluxes are expected similar if they are

-   at similar environmental conditions

    -   Rg $\pm$ 50 $W m^{-2}$, Tair $\pm$ 2.5 $°C$, and VPD $\pm$ 5.0
        $h Pa$

-   and close in time

    -   increasing time window until enough observations \## “mean
        diurnal course” (MDC) Fluxes are expected similar if they are

-   at the same time of the day

-   not too many days away

-   The methods are effective for short gaps as the missing values are
    replaced by the average of response variables under similar weather
    conditions in a small-time window; Combines LUT and MDC

Quality flag increases with fewer variables and larger time windows

-   0 Observations
-   1 gap-filled with good quality
-   $>1$ gap-filled with lower quality

```{r}
# fingerplot: inspect gaps needed to be filled
EProc$sPlotFingerprintY("NEE", Year = 2011); EProc$sPlotFingerprintY("NEE", Year = 2012)
# use MDS to gapfill flux data
EProc$sMDSGapFillUStarScens('NEE')

# gaps in flux data are filled 
EProc$sPlotFingerprintY("NEE_50._f", Year = 2011); EProc$sPlotFingerprintY("NEE_50._f", Year = 2012)
```


# 07: partitioning NEE into Reco and GPP
-   NEE = Reco - GPP
-   Reco is modeled and GPP is computed as Reco - NEE;

There are three approaches to partition FCO₂ available in REddyProc:
- Night-time partitioning (NT): This approach relies on the assumption that fluxes measured at night consist purely of respiration. It uses nighttime fluxes to estimate a seasonally varying reference respiration rate and its sensitivity to temperature.
- Day-time partitioning (DT): This method uses a light response curve based on daytime data to estimate the reference respiration rate, and then applies a temperature response function to estimate Reco.
- Modified day-time partitioning: both NT and DT assume that the same Rref is applicable during daytime as at night; a questionable assumption due to the potential for the inhibition of leaf respiration in the light

```{r}
# TimeZoneHour: time zone offset from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), without daytime saving
EProc$sSetLocationInfo(LatDeg = 44.0646, LongDeg = -71.2881, TimeZoneHour = -5)
EProc$sFillVPDFromDew() # fill longer gaps still present in VPD_f
EProc$sMRFluxPartitionUStarScens("NEE") # night-time

# If you want to use day-time or night-time partitioning
# EProc$sGLFluxPartitionUStarScens() # day-time
# EProc$sTKFluxPartitionUStarScens() # modified day-time
names(EProc$sTEMP)

Bonus training: create some figures to compare different partitioning method;
